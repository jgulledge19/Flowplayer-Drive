# Basic Flowplayer Drive for MODX

Project will get a list of videos and present in a play list based on a valid Tag search.

Need to create the following system settings:
 - flowplayerdrive.username
 - flowplayerdrive.password
 - flowplayerdrive.session.expires
 
Then create getDriveVideos snippet and the two chunks: flowPlayerClip and flowPlayerVideo
 
Basic example: core/components/flowplayerdrive/elements/chunks/example.html
